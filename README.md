# Python maze game

This is my old school project. Code is very bad, but if you want to test how it works, just run:

`git clone https://github.com/makubas/python-maze-game`

`cd python-maze-game`

If you don't have installed pygame - `pip install pygame`

`python main.py`

You should see a game window now. Move the player using WSAD or arrow keys and collect blue points in time.
There are only 2 maps, but it is easy to add more.
